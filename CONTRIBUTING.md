# Contributing to Snippets

Thanks for your interest! This repository supports clean, readable, reusable code in the social sector.

Please follow these guidelines:

- Use Python 3
- Stick to popular, free libraries (e.g., pandas, seaborn)
- All scripts must be documented and runnable
- Notebooks should include markdown instructions and sample inputs
- Keep functions modular â€” 1 purpose per script
