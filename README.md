# Python Snippets Repository

Welcome! This is a growing library of reusable Python functions and templates that I use across data analysis, MEL, and research workflows — especially in the fields of public health, gender, education, climate resilience, and women's economic empowerment in India and South Asia.

This repository is designed to help analysts, researchers, and program teams working with real-world datasets — where cleaning, formatting, and meaningful summaries are just as important as modelling. Each script is modular, documented, and ready to adapt.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

The snippets are grouped by task and written entirely in Python using widely supported open libraries.

### 🧼 Cleaning
- Rename columns, fix data types, handle missing values
- Great for preprocessing survey or admin datasets

### 📊 EDA
- Quick profile reports
- Correlation checks
- Group summaries (e.g. gender, caste, geography)

### 📈 Modelling
- OLS, logistic regression, diagnostics
- Multicollinearity and regression output summaries

### 📊 Visualisation
- Annotated plots, residual diagnostics
- Clean graphics for reporting or dashboard use

### 📂 I/O Helpers
- Read large `.csv`, `.sav`, `.dta` files
- Export styled Excel tables (summary reports, shareable outputs)

### 🌍 Social Sector
- Education outcome comparisons
- Gender-disaggregated summaries
- WEE time-use patterns
- Public health access indices
- Flagging climate-exposed geographies

### 🧪 Validation
- Use `pydantic` to enforce clean inputs and configs
- Helpful for reproducible pipelines and safe team workflows

## 🚀 Designed For

- Program teams working in MEL and research roles  
- Analysts handling messy survey, NFHS/NSSO-style data  
- Researchers translating quantitative work into usable insights  

All scripts include explanatory comments. You’re welcome to adapt, reuse, or extend for your own work.
