### ðŸ—º Spatial Tools

EquityStack uses:
- `geopandas` for reading, transforming, and joining shapefiles
- `folium` for interactive mapping (especially useful for dashboards)
- Sample `.geojson` and `.csv` overlays for public health or climate data

These tools let you generate programmatic maps and embed them in reports or dashboards.
